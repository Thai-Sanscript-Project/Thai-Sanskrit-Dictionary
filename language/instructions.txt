How to setup:
to configure this system, you need to upload all files in whichever directory 
of your web space with PHP Support, then looking for the line:
"$config->dir     = "PERCORSO";
replace the value "PERCORSO" with relative path to your languageset directory
es: /home/margini/ecc.../languageset/
                               
 -----------------------   FILE = index.php3   --------------------------
<?
// Silvio Terzi kakchan@italyjapan.com www.dawnofdreams.org www.japanworlds.it 
class object {};
$config = new object;
$config->dir     = "PERCORSO";
if (! isset($lang)) {
	$lang = "it";
}
else if ($lang == "it" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "it"; }
else if ($lang == "us" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "en"; }
$config->global = $config->dir.$lang."/language.php";
include ($config->global);
?>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<?=$phrase1?>
</body>
</html>

Step 2:
Create a directory called: "languageset" in Your Home/user/ directory
in this directory create another two directories called: "it" and "us"
with inside, file called: language.php (in each directory)

Step 3:
collect all information you want to multilinguagize:)

Step 4:
insert these phrase in "language.php" files (in "us" and "it" directory, 
remember to translate the phrase in the two different language [italian and english]), 
in this syntax:
 ------------------------ language.php ---------------------------
$example = "examplee";

**** REMEMBER TO WRITE "<?php" at the begining and "?>" at the ending of the "language.php" files *******

Step 5:
an example of multilinguage code in "index.php3" can be (for the example up):
<body>
<?=$phrase1?>
</body>

**** you write <?=$phrase1?> in index.php3 only if you have write $phrase1 in language.php3 files
if you have declared a variabile called $bimbino in language.php3 files. you must write <?=$bimbino?>
in index.php3 ****

Step 6:
fill language.php files at your request and place the variabiles in the form <?=variabile?> in index.php3..

TIPS: 
you can rename index.php3 at your request
you make everything you want on index.php3 file, but you must hold the php line:

<?
/* Php Multilanguage System (c) 2000 Silvio Terzi (kakchan@crosswinds.net)
                ----------- http://www.kakchan.com -----------          */

class object {};
$config = new object;
$config->dir     = "PERCORSO";
if (! isset($lang)) {
	$lang = "it";
}
else if ($lang == "it" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "it"; }
else if ($lang == "us" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "en"; }
$config->global = $config->dir.$lang."/language.php";
include ($config->global);
?>

at the beginning of the file.....
after this code write everithing you want!!

EXAMPLE OF THE MULTILANGUAGE FILE SET:

index.php3
languageset     <DIR>
     	en 	<DIR>
         	language.php
     	it 	<DIR>
       		language.php

Step 7:
               HOW TO ADD MORE LANGUAGE:

Sub-Step 1:
create the language directories in "languageset" dir
call this with name like "fr" for frech, "jp" for japanese
 
Sub-Step 2:
edit index.php3
look the line 
else if ($lang == "it" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "it"; }
add another similar below:
es: else if ($lang == "jp" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "jp"; } 
(if you had created a folder called "jp" in your languageset directory with
the dictionary inside(language.php)

Sub-Step 3:
to delete a language simply delete a line like (of the language u wanna delete:))
else if ($lang == "it" ) { $SESSION["lang"] = "it"; }

Step 8:
                      HOW TO ACCESS TO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES:
simply direct your browser to these address:
example if the script is in the root directory of the site:
http://www.site.com/index.php3?lang=it (this go to italian version)
http://www.site.com/index.php3?lang=us (this go to english version)
http://www.site.com/index.php3?lang=anotherlanguage (a language you have specified)
and goo on:))
(Tips: if you try http://www.site.com/index.php3 the script redirect you to italian
version, change $lang = "it"; to $lang = "yourlanguage"; in the code:
if (! isset($lang)) {
	$lang = "it";
} )
