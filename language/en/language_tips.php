$lang_tips3="Enter the word";
$lang_tips4="Enter the word that you wish to find into the search field. For writing Czech characters with diacritics or Icelandic characters ð, þ, æ, ö, there is a possibility to click on the character above the search field.
Confirm your search either a) by pressing the button Search or b) by pressing the button Enter.";
$lang_tips5="Possibilities of search";
$lang_tips6="You can search the headword which a) corresponds exactly to the searched word b) begins with the searched word c) contains the searched word d) ends in the searched word";
$lang_tips7="Search fields";
$lang_tips8="It means the field of the database in which you search a headword. The basic and default possibility is to search among the headwords of the Icelandic-Czech Students' Dictionary. 
Another possibility is to search among the translations, for example. It means that the searched word is compared with all translations of meanings of a headword. (If you search the Czech headword “kůň”, for example). In the case of searching Czech headwords, I recommend you to search them through “Containing” (see 1.2 Possibilities of search) because the Czech headword you search may be placed in the entry as the second one. (If you searched the headword through “Beginning with”, you would not find it).";
$lang_tips9="Experiment with the fields";
$lang_tips10="I recommend you to experiment with the fields of the Dictionary. Tip: enter the word “legur”, use “Ends in” and choose the field “Synonyms”. The Dictionary will find all synonyms (for particular meanings of headwords) ending in “legur”.";
$lang_tips11="Another tip: search the headword that you are interested in by using, for example, the field “Example”. The headword will be found in all examples in the Dictionary.";
$lang_tips12="Another interesting possibility may be a search in field categories. Through this, you can get a list of all headwords related to informatics, for example (abbreviation “poč.”).";
$lang_tips13="Headword not found";
$lang_tips14="If the headword is not found, the Dictionary will try to recommend you the word that you maybe meant to find. So, if you accidentally write “hesstur”, the Dictionary will offer you the headword “hestur”.";
$lang_tips15="Search not only the basic forms";
$lang_tips16="You can search not only the basic forms of headwords. You may enter plural forms of nouns, verb forms in the past tense etc. – the Dictionary will find the headword which contains the searched word form in its declension. If there are several headwords containing the searched word, the list of these headwords will appear on the right side of the page."; 
$lang_tips17="More headwords found";
$lang_tips18="If the Dictionary finds more than one headword, it will provide a list of these headwords. If the list contains more than 15 headwords, the Dictionary will offer you navigation buttons for better orientation in the list.";
$lang_tips19="Choose the headword from the list";
$lang_tips20="By clicking on the headword hyperlink, you will get to its entry.";
$lang_tips21="Alphabetical list";
$lang_tips22="On the right, there is the alphabetical list of headwords. You can go forward or back in the list by clicking on the arrows.";
