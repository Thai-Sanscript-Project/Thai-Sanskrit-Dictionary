Brief instructions:<br>
At first, generate the Dictionary to .tex format (Latex format) and then, convert it to .pdf format from which it is possible to print the Dictionary. <br>
<br>
Step by step:<br>
At first, you have to set up the LaTex environment. LaTex is freely available (for free) and it works under Windows, Linux, MacOS (<a href=\"http://www.latex-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.latex-project.org/</a>) <br>
<br>
The following steps for installation of LaTex are related to the Linux and Ubuntu 10.4 environments
(For LaTex Installation Guide for Windows, click on the <a href=\"http://blogspot.i-lasek.cz/software/jak-nainstalovat-a-provozovat-latex-pod-windows/\" target=\"_blank\">web page</a>
<a href=\"http://www.pinteric.com/miktex.html\" target=\"_blank\">in English</a>)
<br>
<a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Internationalization\" target=\"_blank\">Information on language support in LaTex</a>
<br>
1.1 Preparation of Latex environment and of required Latex libraries
Install libraries and related libraries through Synaptic Package Manager (or via command line).
<br>
texlive (texlive-base, texlive-latex-base, texlive-fonts-recommended, tipa, texlive-luatex)
texlive-latex-extra<br>
texlive-lang-czechslovak<br>
texlive-lang-other<br>
texlive-fonts-extra<br>
<br>
Then, it is necessary to install these LaTex libraries (if they were not already installed during the installation of texlive-base and other ones):<br>
fontenc (liblatex-encode-perl)<br>
fix2col<br>
latexsym<br>
<br>
1.2. When everything is ready, at first, generate the test file <strong>/tmp/dictionary_test.tex</strong> in Administration / Dictionary publication and later, do the same in the complete generation of the Dictionary to the file <strong>/tmp/dictionary.tex</strong><br>
1.3. The file <strong>dictionary_test.tex</strong> / <strong>dictonary.tex</strong> will be sent to you via e-mail or you will find it on the server in the directory <strong>/tmp/dictionary_test.tex /tmp/dictionary.tex</strong><br>
1.4. Save the file into your computer to the directory /tmp/<br>
<br>
For the correct conversion of the file dictionary.tex to the PDF file, it is necessary to:<br>
1.5. copy photographs from the directories /images/biolib/ and /images/uploaded_files/ on the server. Keep the same path.<br>
In the generated file <strong>/tmp/dictionary.tex</strong>, edit real absolute path to your photographs.<br>
E.g.<br>
\graphicspath{{/home/autor/icelandic-czech_dictionary/images/biolib/}{/home/autor/icelandic-czech_dictionary/images/uploaded_files/}}<br>
LaTex needs to know the path to photographs, if it does not find the path, it will report error and will not show the photograph.<br>
If you want to print without photographs, edit the file fileprint.php (part action==latex)<br>
<br>
1.6. Print – command line – convert from .tex to .pdf<br>
by entering the command pdflatex, you convert <strong>dictionary_test.tex</strong> / <strong>dictonary.tex</strong> to <strong>dictionary_test.pdf</strong> / <strong>dictonary.pdf</strong><br>
<br>
pdflatex dictionary.tex / pdflatex dictionary_test.tex<br>
<br>
Control the PDF file, whether its formatting is correct, whether there are all photographs, etc. Control the Guide to the Dictionary – if you want to edit this introductory part, edit the file <strong>/language/cz/dictionary_instructions.tex</strong> and generate the file again.<br>
<br>
2. Book format<br>
To prepare the PDF file for book format (two pages on one sheet, 20 pages bound in a booklet form), use java scripts <a href=\"http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Multivalent </a><br> 
Copy the file /tmp/Multivalent.jar to the directory /tmp in the local computer or download the previous version (the latest one does not contain Impose tools) and save it to the directory /tmp<br>
see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/465271/gluing-imposition-pdf-documents\" target=\"_blank\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/465271/gluing-imposition-pdf-documents</a><br>
<br>
<br>
If Multivalent is zipped, unzip it into the directory /tmp/ in the local computer. Now, the directory /tmp should contain Multivalent.jar (or something similar)<br>
<br>
It is necessary to have the latest version of Java. If it does not work, visit forums - <a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1659231\" target=\"_blank\">e.g. here</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Enter the directory /tmp in your computer through the terminal. Then, enter the following command to the command line and, at the same time, set up the correct path to the directory /tmp and, eventually, edit the name of the PDF file that you want to convert. <br>
<br>
java -classpath /home/autor/icelandic-czech_dictionary/tmp/Multivalent.jar tool.pdf.Impose -dim 2x1 -verbose -paper-size \"42.2x28cm\" -layout \"1,20,19,2,3,18,17,4,5,16,15,6,7,14,13,8,9,12,11,10\" dictionary.pdf<br>
(<strong>Multivalent.jar</strong> and <strong>dictionary.pdf</strong> are in the same directory /tmp/)<br>
(it prints two pages on one sheet, reverses it and typesets it after a pattern for book format (20 original pages in each booklet) – in duplex printing mode, there are 5 pages)<br>";
