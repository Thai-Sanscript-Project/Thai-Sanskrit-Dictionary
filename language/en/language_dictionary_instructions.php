<h4>9.2 Theoretical example</h4>
Theoretical example is the example in which the object is represented by the indefinite pronoun in the case with which the word is connected; in general, the verb is in the infinitive form. If the subject is not in the nominative (in the case of impersonal verbs, for example), the verb is indicated in the form of the 3rd person singular of the present tense.
For phrases, the abbreviations of Icelandic words „einhver“ (somebody) and „eitthvað“ (something) are used. These abbreviations indicate a) the case and b) the animateness or inanimateness of the object<br>
Explanation of abbreviations: 
<span class=\"abb_guide_zkr\">e-ð</span>  - „eitthvað“ (accusative, inanimate object), <span class=\"abb_guide_zkr\">e-n</span>  - „einhvern“ (accusative, animate object), <span class=\"abb_guide_zkr\">e-u</span> - „einhverju“ (dative, inanimate object), <span class=\"abb_guide_zkr\">e-m</span> – „einhverjum“ (dative, animate object), <span class=\"abb_guide_zkr\">e-s</span> - „einhvers“ (genitive, inanimate object), <span class=\"abb_guide_zkr\">e-rs</span> - „einhvers“ (genitive, animate object)<br>";
$lang_di_title9_sub3="We read the example as „leita að einhverju“ (hledat co) and „leita að einhverjum“ (hledat koho). In this case, the verb connects with the dative and the object can be both animate and inanimate.";
$lang_di_title9_sub4="Practical example";
$lang_di_title9_sub5="In the Dictionary, there are a large number of practical examples and their translations. The practical example differs from the theoretical example by the fact that, instead of the indefinite pronoun, the phrase contains the word frequent in oral expression.
